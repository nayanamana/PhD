# Another Look at TLS Ecosystems in Networked Devices vs. Web Servers

This is an extension to our paper published in Financial Cryptography and Data Security 2017 conference (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167404818306916). In this work we carry out a historical analysis of TLS vulnerabilities of devices compared to Alexa-1M web sites between 2016-2018.

In this page, we host the scripts used for our analysis including instructions using them. However, the processed Censys dataset can only be released upon requesting the authors for non-commercial use with the consent of Censys support (support@censys.io).

Download the scripts to transform Censys data to an intermediary format and analyze. The instructions to guide the process is also in the compressed archive (device_analysis_README.txt).
